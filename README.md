Misleading name, this is not a keygen, this is an attempt at a keygen that turned horribly wrong... :)

Interesting licenses protection system.
Licenses are of the form ABCDE-FGHIJ-KLMNO-PRQST-UVWXY and are stored inside resources assets in the .NET compiled project as md5 binary hashes.
So basically a certain amount of licenses are directly provided inside the program (250,000 serial numbers to be exact) and the only protection there against keygen is the impossible number of possibilities to bruteforce them all...
The only reasonable way to bypass it is to directly inject your serial number inside the executable file, and it works like a charm.

Anyway, I was really surprised by this way of doing this, hence the publication.
